1. Compilation
This game requires following libraries to run and compile successfully:
- SDL2
- SDL2 image
- SDL2 ttf

1.1. Compilation for Linux

1.1.1. Installing libraries

To install required libraries on Debian-based distros run:
# apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

1.1.2. Compiling

To compile run make

This will produce "kik" binary in main tree.

1.2. Compilation for Windows using Mingw-w64

There's no need to download any libraries, they are inscluded within this repository. To compile game for Windows using Mingw-w64 run:
!!!WARNING!!! I didn't try to compile game under Windows using MSVC++ or something similar. If you want to do this all libraries and headers are in winsdl directory !!!WARNING!!!

$ ./build-windows.sh

This will produce ready to play game in winbuild directory

2. Launching

On Windows and Linux simply double click. From commandline run ./kik or .\kik.exe (Windows)

3. Configuring

Currently only resolution changing is supported. To do this create file config.txt in the same directory where is game binary and write following lines:
X_RESOLUTION
Y_RESOLUTION

where X_RESOLUTION is x resolution and Y_RESOLUTION is y resolution. They both should be equal.

If no config.txt is present game defaults to 600x600 resolution.
